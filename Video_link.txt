Video Description: The following presentation showcase’s Group 11’s Yelp data analysis and answers to the business questions in Track 2: Ratings Prediction. Our main objective is to enhance customer experience and business performance through data-driven insights for the participating businesses on Yelp. Utilizing the data on customer reviews, customer profiles, and business profiles, we plan to address answer 3 key questions: 


1) Given a business profile and a customer profile, can we estimate the rating that the customer would give to the business? 
2) What are the key features in the business profile/customer profile that influence a customer’s impression of a business?
3) How can businesses address any identifiable trends in customer rating behaviors?
